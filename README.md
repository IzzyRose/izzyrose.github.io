## Update 2024: Upgrading to Next.js
This site was previously used in my school years, and was a basic HTML/CSS page.
Now it is being upgraded in an effort to practice my React skills/more accurately reflect my professional skills with a Next.js web app. I will be taking a screenshot of what it used to be so then this readme + the site itself can record my progress.
